            and his creative and music genius, 
            the heavy metal band AC/DC produced the classic album Highway to Hell. 
            In 1980, on a chilly February night in London, Scott drank heavily, as usual. 
            Scott succumbed to his alcoholism that night choking on his own vomit. Though his 
            family cremated him and tossed his ashes into the wind, they erected the

        <h2 id=bonScott>Bon Scott - On the Highway To Hell</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Bon Scott was born in Kirriemuir, Scotland. His family immigrated to 
            Melbourne, Australia, when he was six. Australia wasn’t kind to the young Scott:
            he dropped out of high school at fifteen, did a stint in prison for various offenses. 
            and was rejected by the Australian Army. The army's reason for his rejection summed up 
            his early life - “socially maladjusted”.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Scott's powerful voice fronted a string of locally successful bands: 
            The Specktors, The Valentines, the progressive rock band, The Fraternity and The Mount Lofty Rangers. 
            After one of his trademark nights, of drinking Jack Daniels. A beliigenrent and angry 
            Scott stormed out of a Mount Lofty Ranger rehearsal and crashed his motorcycle. 
            Nearly three weeks later, Scott emerged from the hospital - without a band.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Ironically, that accident might have been a blessing in disguise for Scott. 
            Scott’s ex-wife noted in her book: “Well I did feel that after he had the neck injury 
            and broken collarbone and a cut in his throat, his voice didn’t sound the same,” 
            Irene said in the book. “He didn’t seem to be able to do the same thing - he was 
            doing a lot of melodic singing before, had a beautiful tone in his voice, 
            but I don’t think that (tone) was the voice he ended up with or that what he had 
            (before) was the AC/DC voice everyone knows.”</li>
          <br />
          <li>After he recovered, Scott set out looking for a new band to front. 
              While he looked, Scott worked odd jobs, putting up posters, painting and even acting as a chauffeur 
             for his future bandmates - AC/DC. 
             A friend of Scott's, set up an audition. Prior to the audition, Scott watched the band 
             and wondered if they could rock and thought they were “too young and experienced”. 
             The founder's of AC/DC Malcolm and Angus Young intial impression of Scott, 
             “too old to rock”.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Despite their initial impressions of each other and after a jam session Scott 
            took over as the frontman for AC/DC. Scott’s troubled past influenced the band, 
            injecting his rebellious and rowdy past into the creative energy of AC/DC. 
            “Socially maladjusted” might adequately describe the group’s direction with songs like: 
            If You Want Blood, JailBreak, High Voltage, Shot Down In Flames, TNT, 
            Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Problem Child and Hell Ain’t a Bad Place To Be. 
            One cannot forget the rock-and-roll classic that might have mirrored Scott’s life 
            - Highway to Hell.</li>

          <li>"Well I did feel that after he had the neck injury and broken collarbone 
             and a cut in his throat, his voice didn’t sound the same," Irene said in the 
             book. "He didn’t seem to be able to do the same thing - he was doing a lot 
             of melodic singing before, had a beautiful tone in his voice, but I don’t 
             think that (tone) was the voice he ended up with or that what he had (before) 
             was the AC/DC voice everyone knows."</li>
          <br />
          <li>In Febuary of 1980, after a heavy night of drinking, Scott crawled into the backseat 
            of his car to sleep it off. Friends found Scott dead in the morning, 
            his car covered in vomit. </li>
          <br />
          <li>AC/DC hired Brian Johnson and debuted their first album without Scott 
            six months after his death - Back in Black. </li>
          <br />
          <li>Over the years, there’s been a dispute over who was the creative genius 
            behind Back in Black - Brian Johnson, Angus and Malcolm Young or Bon Scott. 
            An ex-girlfriend claimed to have seen notebooks and lyrics 
            to the rock-and-roll classic You Shook Me All Night Long. 
            The young brothers refuted this claim publically. However, no one disputes 
            Scott’s creative genius, his unique and powerful voice, and his influence on 
            AC/DC’s rise to international success.</li>
