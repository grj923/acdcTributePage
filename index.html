            and his creative and music genius, 
            the heavy metal band AC/DC produced the classic album Highway to Hell. 
            In 1980, on a chilly February night in London, Scott drank heavily, as usual. 
            Scott succumbed to his alcoholism that night choking on his own vomit. Though his 
            family cremated him and tossed his ashes into the wind, they erected the

        <h2 id=bonScott>Bon Scott - On the Highway To Hell</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Bon Scott was born Ronald Belford Scott in Kirriemuir, Scotland on 
            July 9, 1946. When he was six, his family decided to move to 
            Melbourne, Australia.</li>
          <br />
          <li>He dropped out of school at 15 and was eventually arrested for stealing gasoline.</li>
          <br />
          <li>After that, he was rejected by the Australian army and spent several years working odd jobs. 
            But Bon Scott always had a powerful voice and in 1966, he started his first band, the Spektors. 
            Scott found some minor success in these early years touring with different bands.</li>
          <br />
          <li>In 1974, a drunken Scott got into an argument with members of the band 
            he was playing with. After throwing a bottle of Jack Daniels on the floor, he took off on his motorcycle. 
            Scott suffered a serious crash and was in a coma for several days.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Scott's ex-wife, Irene Thornton, noted in her book Bon Scott, his voice changed 
            after the accident, where he suffered a neck injury, broken collarbone and a cut throat.</li>
          <br />
          <li>"Well I did feel that after he had the neck injury and broken collarbone 
             and a cut in his throat, his voice didn’t sound the same," Irene said in the 
             book. "He didn’t seem to be able to do the same thing - he was doing a lot 
             of melodic singing before, had a beautiful tone in his voice, but I don’t 
             think that (tone) was the voice he ended up with or that what he had (before) 
             was the AC/DC voice everyone knows."</li>
          <br />
          <li>By the time he recovered, he was looking for a new band. As luck would have it, 
            a new band formed by two fellow emigrant Scotsmen, Malcolm and Angus Young, was also 
            looking for a singer.</li>
          <br />
          <li>It was through Scott’s checkered past and rebellious attitude that the band cemented 
             itself as a raucous, crude rock group. Scott, who had been rejected from the 
             army because he was “socially maladjusted,” brought that attitude into AC/DC. 
             And it stuck.</li>
          <br />
          <li>AC/DC continued to enjoy success, especially upon the release of their album 
            Back in Black which debuted just five months after Scott’s death.</li>
          <br />
          <li>An ex-girlfriend of his claims to have seen his journals and notebooks with lyrics to 
            the infamous You Shook Me All Night Long prior to his death. 
            Some felt he deserved credit for the album posthumously and not his 
            replacement, Brian Johnson.</li>
